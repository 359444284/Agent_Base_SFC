Report on the development of an ABM stock-flow consistent model.

**model02**: the current version of the framework capable of handling micro-founded macro research questions. Have a look [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/terna/ejmmp/blob/main/model02/model02.ipynb). Pressing the button <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terna/ejmmp/main/myBinder.png" alt="myBinder" style="zoom:25%;" /> it is possible to run the model interactively via the [**binder**](https://mybinder.org) project.

Comments welcome. Please do not quote.
