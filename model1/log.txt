1. THE UNINFORMED PLANNER ACTING 

Comparing data_analysis planner with the folders (and the corresponding condition in plannerMethods): 
- PlannerNoInv(incrementAndSubstitutions = 'zero')
- PlannerTotalInv (incrementAndSubstitutions = 'total')
- PlannerRandom (incrementAndSubstitutions = 'random')

Production inputs are currently random.

Assignations (zero/random/total) are NOT consistent with the investment goods collection.
If the planner assigns more than how much has been collected interally, imports of investment goods will occur (a kind of compensation mechanism out of the model itself).
